title: A Year with Swollen Appendices

I've been reading a lot this year, much of it pretty fast. As an exercise in savoring, I've got a little reading project I'm planning on taking slowly over the next year-ish.

The book is "A Year with Swollen Appendices: Brian Eno's Diary" and it's originally from 1995 (though I have an anniversary edition). The aim is to keep in sync with the diary; one page a day.

I don't feel like waiting until January, so I'll be seasonally shifted. I'm already off by almost 30 years and 100+ degrees of longitude so this doesn't seem like a big deal. Today, July 15, was Eno's January 1. I'm not honestly sure if he skips any days, though I like my odds of missing it here and there, so I'll be back here in a year-ish!

In honor of new district numbers from the Census, here is a bad way to redraw the 11 congressional districts of my home state. They're not compact, but they are contiguous and have equal(ish) population!

Please excuse the garish colorway--I don't want to point fingers, but this is the default QGIS gave me...

Also, in the interest of full disclosure, these are based on 2010 [blocks and population counts](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010BLKPOPHU/). Couldn't find more recent population data at this (or census tract) level.

Thinking I'll make a few more of these!

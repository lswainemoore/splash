I, LSM (Lincoln Swaine-Moore), am learning for the first time of my namesake[1], [LSM (log-structured merge) trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree). Even more serendipitous, they were first described in a paper published in [June 1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002360050048), which happens to be exactly one year after I was published.

[1] How odd that this word means either the source or the destination of a shared name. Delightfully useless. In this case, interpret as you please.

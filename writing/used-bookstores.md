### An opinionated and incomplete list

I love used bookstores, and I've put in my hours browsing at a few places in the city. These are the ones I find myself returning to, in no particular order. You could probably accurately triangulate my apartment using this list, so that's an obvious bias.

#### [Adobe Books](https://www.adobebooks.com/)

This place pulls me like a magnet. Probably every other Sunday, I find myself meandering in its direction. Sometimes I just poke my head in to browse the "recent arrivals" cart. Sometimes I lose a half hour rifling through the collection of mass market classics.

#### [Dog Eared Books](https://www.dogearedbooks.com/)

Popular, open late, and with a good rotating set of "on sale" books (new but priced pretty close to used). I've found a few really interesting used Dover-style math books here.

#### [Green Apple Books (on Clement)](https://greenapplebooks.com/)

A big name for a reason. Huge selection and probably the best outside bargain bins I've seen in the city. I'm not super into the other location, but that may just be a matter of my personal aesthetics.

#### [Et al. books](https://etaletc.com/bookshop)

This place keeps a low profile, so I actually just visited it for the first time. A friend had mentioned his class had a reading here, but I ended up just stumbling on it a couple weeks later. Really excellent selection of interesting editions. Highest "oh wow they have that!"s per shelf than anywhere else on here. Like some other places, there's a gallery in the back, and they host talks/community events.

#### [Community Thrift](https://www.communitythriftsf.org/)

Not exactly a bookstore, but large book section and incredible deals to be had here. Most stuff is between $1 and $3. They get new stuff very regularly, and sometimes I encounter a chunk of recently arrived books that clearly came from someone with very similar taste to mine. Selection that's made it to alphebetization is a little more hit or miss (lots of duplicates), but plenty of good stuff in there.

#### [Books & Bookshelves](https://booksandbookshelves.com/)

It's all in the name. I haven't bought a bookshelf here, but they're all over the shop (filled and unfilled), and they look well made! I have bought books from the nice proprietor (David, I think).

#### Honorable Mentions

Great places, but I have less to say about them right now:

- [Forest Books](https://www.instagram.com/forestbookssf/)
- [Medicine for Nightmares](https://medicinefornightmares.com/)

And then there's [Moe's](https://www.moesbooks.com/) in Berkeley, which is outside the purview of this list, but is unparalleled in its selection, particularly technical fare.

#### On my list

- [Bird & Beckett](https://birdbeckett.com/)
- [Bolerium Books](https://www.bolerium.com/)
- [Friends Bookstore (at the Main Library)](https://www.friendssfpl.org/bookstore.html)

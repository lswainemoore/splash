How on earth did this random Youtube channel end up with this high-value redirect? 

[https://www.youtube.com/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/playlists)

Most of the other "video-y" keywords ("shorts", "subscriptions", "channels", etc.) seem to go legitimate places or 404, but somehow @USACELEBRITIES (/ @HindiListeners, according the banner) got ahold of this one.

As far as I can tell it's just a run-of-the-mill content farm. I wonder if they were just trying out various vanity handles and lucked out. Good for them.
